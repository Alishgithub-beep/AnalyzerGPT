This is a multiagent project which solve the data analysis problems. 
It have 2 agents working simulataneous in a autogen team to solve problems.
1. Data analyst agent perform data analysis and generate the python code for analysis using required libraries.
2. Code executer agent runs the code on docker command line executer.
Prompting is done to reduce the hallucinations.
This project automated the process of analysis for me about 70%.
